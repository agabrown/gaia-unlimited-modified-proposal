# gaia-unlimited-modified-proposal
Modified version of GaiaUnlimited H2020 proposal
 
Following the approval of the [GaiaUnlimited proposal](https://github.com/agabrown/Gaia-Selection-Function-H2020) a number of modifications are requested to be made to the proposal before the Grant Agreement with the EC is signed. This repository contains the modified proposal.

The [EU RIA H2020 Proposal template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/eu-ria-h2020-proposal-template/tzrcxdztpgzk) is
used as a basis for writing the proposal in LaTeX. Some small changes were made to the `h2020proposal.cls` file in order to
conform to the latest [H2020 templates](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/call_ptef/pt/2018-2020/h2020-call-pt-ria-ia-2018-20_en.pdf).
