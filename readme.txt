Dear template user,
I hope this LaTeX class will be as useful to you as it has been for me. I managed to write several succssful proposals with it, with large teams and sometimes very large documents.

If you do use it to write a real H2020 proposal, please send me an email: giacomo@ini.phys.ethz.ch to ackonwledge this.
I would like to keep a record of how many times the class has been used.

Good luck with your submission!

giacomo
