  % Work Package Objectives
  \begin{wpobjectives}
    The objective of this work package is to research and implement a precise mathematical formulation of the concept of a survey selection function. The results will be written up as a scientific paper (to be published in the open access peer-reviewed literature) that will guide the rest of the work to be done within {\acro}.  The mathematical formulation of the selection function will account for the following aspects:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Applicability to arbitrary astronomical sky surveys.
        \item Selection functions for combinations of surveys can be described within the same formalism.
        \item Accommodate multiple selection layers (e.g., the selection function intrinsic to a survey combined with additional selections imposed by the user of the data).
        \item Unknowable aspects of the selection function should be included. For example, it is not guaranteed that all sources of data loss along the detection-telemetry-processing chain for Gaia can be traced, but this can be approximated through knowing which repeated measurements were included in the catalogue when expected.
    \end{itemize}
